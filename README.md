## Introduction

These are my vim config files. I've taken bits and pieces from
other people's vim config files and configured vim to my liking.

This is a work in progress and if you find it useful, by all means
have at it.

## Installation

  `curl -LJ0 https://raw.github.com/atourino/vimfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | sh`

## Inspiration

* [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
* [Vincent Driessen's vim files](https://github.com/nvie/vimrc)
* [Jeff Kreeftmeijer](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/dotfiles)
* [Armin Ronacher](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/dotfiles)

## Huge props to

* [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) and [Martin Grenfell](https://github.com/scrooloose) for putting out really useful vim plugins.

Cheers,
Antonio
